Age – Age at cancer diagnosis (years). Sex – Male or Female. FamilyHistory – Whether the patient has a family history of cancer (binary). SmokingStatus – Whether the patient is a current smoker (binary). BMI – Patient’s Body Mass Index (BMI). OS_Months – Overall survival in months, influenced by patient characteristics and treatment type. PFS_Months – Progression-free survival, derived as a proportion of OS. CompleteResponse (CR) – Binary variable indicating if the patient achieved a complete response to treatment.

Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

The data comes from the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and explores substance use trends among Americans aged 50-64.\nThe analysis highlights that marijuana is the most commonly used drug in this age group, followed by prescription medications such as pain relievers and tranquilizers. These trends reflect the changing social attitudes, medical prescriptions, and generational differences in drug use. The following visualization replicates FiveThirtyEight’s graph showing the percentage of older Americans who reported drug use in the past year."

The SEX and RACE variables need clarification, as we don’t know whether 1 = Male or Female, and what categories 7 and 88 in RACE represent.

While the accuracy seems promising, the low ROC-AUC suggests that the model might be overfitting or predicting well for a dominant class but not capturing meaningful patterns."

The ROC-AUC of 0.978 suggests that the model can almost perfectly distinguish between male and female participants, making very few classification errors. Compared to the simpler model (ROC-AUC = 0.59), this is a substantial improvement, confirming that additional predictors provide meaningful information for classification. The high ROC-AUC suggests that the model captures strong patterns in the data, making it highly reliable for predicting SEX."

These results remain consistent with the previous cross-validation, where Model 2 outperformed Model 1. The slight fluctuations in RMSE values and standard errors highlight the impact of data splitting randomness, especially with smaller datasets.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful. So let’s fix that first.\n\nd1 &lt;- rawdata %&gt;% dplyr::filter( Height != \"sixty\" ) %&gt;% \n                  dplyr::mutate(Height = as.numeric(Height))\nskimr::skim(d1)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nd1\n\n\nNumber of rows\n13\n\n\nNumber of columns\n3\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nnumeric\n2\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nGender\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nHeight\n0\n1.00\n151.62\n46.46\n6\n154.00\n165\n175\n192\n▁▁▁▂▇\n\n\nWeight\n1\n0.92\n647.92\n2000.48\n45\n54.75\n73\n90\n7000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\nhist(d1$Height)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we see that there is one person with a height of 6.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
