Age – Age at cancer diagnosis (years). Sex – Male or Female. FamilyHistory – Whether the patient has a family history of cancer (binary). SmokingStatus – Whether the patient is a current smoker (binary). BMI – Patient’s Body Mass Index (BMI). OS_Months – Overall survival in months, influenced by patient characteristics and treatment type. PFS_Months – Progression-free survival, derived as a proportion of OS. CompleteResponse (CR) – Binary variable indicating if the patient achieved a complete response to treatment.

Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Pooja/Pooja/Spring 2025/EPID-BIOS-8060E-MADA/mohammedzuber-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

The total drug (Y) distribution appears right-skewed, with a large range from 826.4 to 5606.6, suggesting potential outliers. The DOSE variable is unevenly distributed, with fewer individuals in the 37.5 mg group, which may impact statistical comparisons. The SEX and RACE variables need clarification, as we don’t know whether 1 = Male or Female, and what categories 7 and 88 in RACE represent. No missing values were detected, which is a good sign, but we should further investigate outliers, correlations, and transformations to improve data reliability before modeling."

Model 1, which only considers DOSE as a predictor, has a higher RMSE (702.79) but still performs better than the null model. The null model, which simply predicts the mean outcome for each observation, has the highest RMSE (948.35), suggesting that it does not capture meaningful variability in the data. These results highlight that incorporating additional predictors improves model performance, as seen in the lower RMSE for Model 2 compared to Model 1 and the null model.Model 2 (which includes all predictors) has the lowest RMSE, meaning it provides the best fit to the training data. Model 1, which only considers DOSE, performs better than the null model but is still not as effective as Model 2. The null model, which simply predicts the mean outcome for each observation, has the highest RMSE, indicating it does not capture meaningful variability in the data.\n\n\n6.1.6 Model performance assessment 2\n\n##Cross-validation (10-fold CV)\nset.seed(rngseed)\ncv_folds &lt;- vfold_cv(train_data, v = 10)\n\ncv_results_1 &lt;- fit_resamples(\n  model_1 %&gt;% set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% set_engine(\"lm\"),\n  Y ~ DOSE,\n  resamples = cv_folds,\n  metrics = metric_set(rmse)\n)\n\ncv_results_2 &lt;- fit_resamples(\n  model_2 %&gt;% set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% set_engine(\"lm\"),\n  Y ~ DOSE + AGE + SEX + WT + HT,\n  resamples = cv_folds,\n  metrics = metric_set(rmse)\n)\n\n##Compute mean RMSE from CV\ncv_rmse_1 &lt;- collect_metrics(cv_results_1)\ncv_rmse_2 &lt;- collect_metrics(cv_results_2)\n\ncv_rmse_1\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err .config             \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 rmse    standard    697.    10    68.1 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\ncv_rmse_2\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err .config             \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 rmse    standard    653.    10    63.6 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\n\nThe 10-fold cross-validation results indicate that Model 2 continues to outperform Model 1, with a mean RMSE of 652.77 standard error 63.60 compared to 696.71 standard error 68.10 for Model 1. Although Model 2 maintains its advantage, the reduction in the RMSE gap between the two models suggests that the additional predictors provide some improvement but not as drastically as seen in the training data alone. The standard errors of 68.10 for Model 1 and 63.60 for Model 2 highlight some variability in model performance across different validation folds. Despite this variability, Model 2 remains the superior choice, as it consistently demonstrates lower RMSE values, indicating better predictive accuracy.\n\n## Re-run with a different seed and compare RMSE variability\n\nset.seed(5678)  # New seed\ncv_folds_new &lt;- vfold_cv(train_data, v = 10)\n\ncv_results_1_new &lt;- fit_resamples(\n  model_1 %&gt;% set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% set_engine(\"lm\"),\n  Y ~ DOSE,\n  resamples = cv_folds_new,\n  metrics = metric_set(rmse)\n)\n\ncv_results_2_new &lt;- fit_resamples(\n  model_2 %&gt;% set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% set_engine(\"lm\"),\n  Y ~ DOSE + AGE + SEX + WT + HT,\n  resamples = cv_folds_new,\n  metrics = metric_set(rmse)\n)\n\ncollect_metrics(cv_results_1_new)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err .config             \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 rmse    standard    698.    10    62.1 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\ncollect_metrics(cv_results_2_new)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err .config             \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 rmse    standard    653.    10    54.1 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\n\nRe-running the 10-fold cross-validation with a different random seed resulted in slight variations in the RMSE values for both models. Model 1, which uses only DOSE as a predictor, had a mean RMSE of 698.05 standard error 62.13, while Model 2, which includes all predictors, had a mean RMSE of 653.12 standard error 54.10. These results remain consistent with the previous cross-validation, where Model 2 outperformed Model 1. The slight fluctuations in RMSE values and standard errors highlight the impact of data splitting randomness, especially with smaller datasets. However, the overall pattern remains unchanged, reaffirming that Model 2 is the better choice for predictive accuracy despite minor variations due to different seed values."

In the filtered dataset, they range from 27 to 805.\nLet’s look at a scatterplot of total murders vs population in the southern states.\n\nggplot(murdersouth, aes(x=population, y=total)) + geom_point(color=\"red\") + scale_x_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, the murders increase with an increase in the population.\nLet’s look at a scatterplot of total murders vs individual states in the southern US.\n\nggplot(murdersouth, aes(x=abb, y=total)) + geom_point(color=\"blue\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that Florida and Texas have relatively higher number of murders compared to the other southern states.\nStatistical models to predict total number of murders\n\n#Based on population\nfit1 = lm(total~population, data=murdersouth)\nsummary(fit1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = total ~ population, data = murdersouth)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-64.58 -40.08 -16.60  28.53 175.41 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Pooja/Pooja/Spring 2025/EPID-BIOS-8060E-MADA/mohammedzuber-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
